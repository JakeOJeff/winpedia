# Winpedia

## WHat is Winpedia?
It is a really cool social media app, but based on winter.

## How it works
If you do not post for the day, your status will remain frozen. If you post less than 2 times a day, you will start to melt. If you post for more than 2 times a day, you will be finally melted!

There is also winter snow, though it make take some time to appear. Please dm @JakeOJeff if it doesn't work as intended!

Post more, burn more and escape the winter with social media!
